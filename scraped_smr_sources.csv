TEA has made significant progress in reviving research and promoting the many industrial applications of Thorium.
We support the training of young women and men in the technologies around the use of Thorium for fuel, medicine, catalysts, alloys, coatings, and superconducting materials. TEA has spent countless hours and resources helping decision makers of the USA understand the opportunities, as well as hundreds of members of the Departments of Energy, NRC, Defense, Commerce and Natural Resources, EPA.
We believe a world of equality, prosperity and abundance can be achieved and the wise use of Thorium can be instrumental in achieving that goal for all of humanity.
