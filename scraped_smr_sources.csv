About Us


Who We Are




NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. is an emerging, early-stage microreactor technology company seeking to become a commercially focused, diversified, vertically integrated technology-driven nuclear energy company. NANO Nuclear is led by a world-class nuclear engineering team developing smaller, cheaper, and safer advanced portable clean energy solutions utilizing proprietary novel reactor designs. NANO Nuclear’s products in technical development are “ZEUS” a solid core battery reactor, and “ODIN” a low-pressure coolant reactor, each representing advanced developments in portable, on-demand capable, advanced nuclear microreactors. HALEU Energy Fuel Inc., a NANO Nuclear subsidiary, is focusing on the future development of a domestic source for a High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel fabrication pipeline for the broader advanced nuclear reactor industry and providing fuel to power NANO Nuclear’s microreactors.

Our Vision






NANO Nuclear Energy is looking to enter the µSMR market by focusing on designing its own nano nuclear reactors which could be deployed to remote locations to provide energy to residential, commercial, major mining, industrial, shipping, oil and gas, military, medical use and construction projects. Additionally, the Company has the bandwidth to invest in optimization research for µSMRs, and seeks collaborative partnerships to which it can deploy financing, provide personnel, and advance technology and development opportunities.


NANO Nuclear Energy intends to progress its collaborative research projects towards development, rigs and models, zero-power reactors, and ultimately towards reactor manufacture and deployments. The Company envisions readily replaceable mobile reactors which it can provide to customers, along with operative personnel, to power projects, residential and commercial enterprises, and major development projects.












“SMRs offer a range of different benefits which complement large reactors. Given their size, small reactors are well-suited for remote areas and in grids that are too small to host a gigawatt-scale nuclear reactor.”




“A further benefit of SMRs is the prospect of so-called modularity, with most, if not all, components of the reactors being manufactured and assembled in a factory before being shipped to a site to be installed.”"

Costs are reduced through factory assembly of reactor modules. Construction time is reduced through simple on-site assembly. This reduces compounding interest that has inflated the cost of traditional nuclear.Metallic coolant and fuel unlocks optimal economicsLiquid metal is able to extract heat from the reactor core much faster than water or gas. This means Aalo reactors can produce up to 10x more energy than competing technologies of a similar size.UZrH fuel miniaturizes safety systemsAalo reactors use UZrH fuel, which is inherently walk-away safe. Commonly used in university research reactors, this fuel automatically shuts itself off if it gets too hot. The result is a significantly simplified safety system, further improving economics. Â Factory ManufacturingIncredible Energy DensitySimplified & Inherent SafetyOur TeamWeâve assembled a team of nuclear experts and leaders from other fields with a passion for shaping the future of energy.And, weâre hiring.

THORIUM WILL POWER THE WORLDThe future of energy is Thorium.Join UsThe Mission of the Thorium Energy Alliance (TEA) Since 2006, has been educating the world on the uses and advantages of Thorium as a Fuel for nuclear power and as a critical material derived from the rare earth metals refining process for free. TEA has made significant progress in reviving research and promoting the many industrial applications of Thorium.
We support the training of young women and men in the technologies around the use of Thorium for fuel, medicine, catalysts, alloys, coatings, and superconducting materials. TEA has spent countless hours and resources helping decision makers of the USA understand the opportunities, as well as hundreds of members of the Departments of Energy, NRC, Defense, Commerce and Natural Resources, EPA.
We believe a world of equality, prosperity and abundance can be achieved and the wise use of Thorium can be instrumental in achieving that goal for all of humanity.TEAC 12 was a Success!April 14th & 15th, 2024
